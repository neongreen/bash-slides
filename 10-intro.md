Bash
=======================================

Goal
---------------------------------------

To get a mental model (rather than learn the exact syntax).

Why
---------------------------------------

a) To not feel confused/frustrated.

b) To start automatic learning (fitting pieces into the mental model).

c) To be able to understand others' scripts, ADO / GitHub pipelines,
Ansible playbooks, Dockerfiles, Makefiles, Nix derivations, etc.
